## Multi-Stream Recording üé¨

The TikTok Live Recorder now supports recording multiple live streams simultaneously! You can record from multiple users, URLs, or room IDs using a single command.

### Usage Examples:

```bash
# Record multiple users simultaneously
python main.py -users username1 username2 username3 -mode automatic

# Import usernames from a text file
python main.py -users-file usernames.txt -mode automatic

# Combine command line users and file import
python main.py -users user1 user2 -users-file usernames.txt -mode automatic

# Record multiple streams from URLs
python main.py -urls "https://www.tiktok.com/@user1/live" "https://www.tiktok.com/@user2/live" -mode manual

# Record multiple streams by room IDs
python main.py -room_ids 123456789 987654321 111222333 -mode automatic
```

### Multi-Stream Features:
- **Simultaneous Recording**: Record multiple streams at the same time using threading
- **Individual File Management**: Each stream is saved as a separate file with unique naming
- **User-Specific Folders**: Recordings are automatically organized in folders named after each user
- **Thread-Safe Logging**: Each stream's activities are logged with thread identifiers
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Stop all recordings cleanly with Ctrl+C
- **Same Configuration**: All streams use the same settings (proxy, output directory, duration, etc.)

### Multi-Stream Arguments:
- `-users`: Space-separated list of TikTok usernames
- `-urls`: Space-separated list of TikTok live URLs
- `-room_ids`: Space-separated list of TikTok room IDs

**Note**: You cannot mix single-stream and multi-stream arguments in the same command.
