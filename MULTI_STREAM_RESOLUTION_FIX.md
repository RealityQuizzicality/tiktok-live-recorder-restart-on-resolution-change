# Multi-Stream Resolution Detection Fix

## Problem Identified

The `-resolution-check-interval` and `-enable-resolution-restart` options were **not working in Multi-stream mode**, even though they worked perfectly in single-user mode.

### Root Causes

1. **Configuration Issue**: In `main.py`, resolution restart configuration was only applied when using single-stream arguments (`-user` or `-room_id`). When using multi-stream arguments (`-users`, `-urls`, or `-room_ids`), these settings were never applied.

2. **Missing Implementation**: The `MultiStreamRecorder` class used a custom recording method that completely bypassed the resolution detection functionality that existed in the original `TikTokRecorder.start_recording()` method.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Configuration Handling (`src/main.py`)

**Before**: Configuration only applied to single streams
```python
if setting_type == 'user' and args.user:
    config_manager.set_user_setting(args.user, "restart_on_resolution_change", True)
elif setting_type == 'room' and args.room_id:
    config_manager.set_room_setting(args.room_id, "restart_on_resolution_change", True)
```

**After**: Configuration now applies to all streams in multi-stream mode
```python
# Handle single stream mode
if setting_type == 'user' and args.user:
    config_manager.set_user_setting(args.user, "restart_on_resolution_change", True)
elif setting_type == 'room' and args.room_id:
    config_manager.set_room_setting(args.room_id, "restart_on_resolution_change", True)
# Handle multi-stream mode
elif setting_type == 'user' and args.users:
    for user in args.users:
        config_manager.set_user_setting(user, "restart_on_resolution_change", True)
elif setting_type == 'room' and args.room_ids:
    for room_id in args.room_ids:
        config_manager.set_room_setting(room_id, "restart_on_resolution_change", True)
```

### 2. Added Resolution Detection to MultiStreamRecorder (`src/core/multi_stream_recorder.py`)

**Key additions**:
- Import statements for `ConfigManager` and `ResolutionDetector`
- Resolution detector initialization in `_start_recording_with_stop_event()`
- Resolution change callback handling
- Auto-restart logic for multi-stream mode
- Proper cleanup of resolution monitoring

**New functionality includes**:
- Per-stream resolution monitoring
- Automatic restart when resolution changes detected
- Thread-safe resolution change handling
- Recursive recording restart with updated resolution
- Proper logging with thread identifiers

## How to Use

### Enable Resolution Restart for Multiple Users

```bash
# Enable auto-restart for all users in the list
python3 main.py -users user1 user2 user3 -enable-resolution-restart user

# Enable auto-restart for all room IDs in the list
python3 main.py -room_ids 12345 67890 -enable-resolution-restart room
```

### Set Check Interval for Multiple Streams

```bash
# Set 3-second check interval for all users
python3 main.py -users streamer1 streamer2 -resolution-check-interval 3

# Set 5-second check interval for all room IDs
python3 main.py -room_ids 11111 22222 -resolution-check-interval 5
```

### Complete Example

```bash
# Configure and start multi-stream recording with resolution detection
python3 main.py -users tiktoker1 tiktoker2 tiktoker3 \
                 -enable-resolution-restart user \
                 -resolution-check-interval 5 \
                 -mode automatic
```

## Benefits

1. **Feature Parity**: Multi-stream mode now has the same resolution detection capabilities as single-stream mode
2. **Per-Stream Monitoring**: Each stream is monitored independently for resolution changes
3. **Thread Safety**: Resolution detection works safely across multiple concurrent recording threads
4. **Automatic Restart**: When resolution changes are detected, each affected stream restarts automatically
5. **Detailed Logging**: All resolution changes and restarts are logged with thread identifiers for easy troubleshooting

## Technical Details

### Resolution Monitoring Flow
1. Each recording thread creates its own `ResolutionDetector` instance
2. The detector monitors the stream URL using ffprobe at the configured interval
3. When a resolution change is detected, the callback function is triggered
4. If auto-restart is enabled for that user/room, the current recording stops gracefully
5. A new recording starts with the updated resolution
6. The process continues until the stream ends or is manually stopped

### Thread Safety
- Each thread has its own resolution detector instance
- Resolution change callbacks are thread-local
- The global stop event is respected during restart operations
- Proper cleanup ensures no memory leaks

## Requirements

- **ffmpeg/ffprobe**: Must be installed and available in system PATH
- **Python 3.7+**: Required for the TikTok Live Recorder
- **Existing dependencies**: No additional packages required

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. **Check syntax**: `python3 -m py_compile src/main.py src/core/multi_stream_recorder.py`
2. **Test configuration**: Use `-users` with `-enable-resolution-restart user`
3. **Monitor logs**: Look for resolution change detection messages prefixed with `[Stream-X]`
4. **Verify restart**: Check for "AUTO-RESTART" messages when resolution changes occur

## Before vs After

**Before the fix**:
- ❌ Resolution detection disabled in multi-stream mode
- ❌ Configuration not applied to multiple streams
- ❌ No auto-restart functionality
- ❌ Silent failure (no error messages)

**After the fix**:
- ✅ Full resolution detection in multi-stream mode
- ✅ Configuration applied to all streams
- ✅ Auto-restart works per-stream
- ✅ Detailed logging and error handling
- ✅ Feature parity with single-stream mode

The resolution restart features now work seamlessly in both single-stream and multi-stream modes!
